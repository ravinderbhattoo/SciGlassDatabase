This model, called {GlassNet}, can predict 85 different properties (such as optical, electrical, dielectric, mechanical, and thermal properties, as well as density, viscosity/relaxation, crystallization, surface tension, and liquidus temperature) of glasses and glass-forming liquids of different chemistries (such as oxides, chalcogenides, halides, and others). The model and the data used to train it are available in the {GlassPy} Python module as free and open source software for the community to use and build upon. As a proof of concept, {GlassNet} was used with the {MYEGA} viscosity equation to predict the temperature dependence of viscosity and outperformed another general purpose viscosity model available in the literature ({ViscNet}) on unseen data. An explainable {AI} algorithm ({SHAP}) was used to extract knowledge correlating the input (physicochemical information) and output (glass properties) of the model, providing valuable insights for glass manufacturing and design. It is hoped that {GlassNet}, with its free and open source nature, can be used to enable faster and better computer-aided design of new technological glasses.},

	abstract = {Despite the use of inorganic glasses for more than 4500 years, the composition–property relationships in these materials remain poorly understood. Here, exploiting largescale experimental data and machine learning, we develop composition–property models for twenty five properties, which are interpreted using game-theoretic concepts. Specifically, we use a dataset consisting of ∼275,000 glass compositions comprising of 221 different components and 25 properties. This is by far the largest model developed in the literature. The analysis reveals that the glass components, such as network formers, modifiers, and intermediates, play distinct roles in governing the optical, physical, electrical, and mechanical properties of glasses. Interestingly, these components exhibit interdependence, the magnitude of which is different for different properties. While the physical origins of some of these interdependencies could be explained using known phenomena, the majority of the remaining ones remain to be explored. Thus, our work paves the way for decoding the “glass genome”, which can provide the recipe for discovering novel glasses while also shedding light on the fundamental factors governing the composition–structure–property relationships.},

	abstract = {Glasses have been an integral part of human life for more than 2000 years. Despite several years of research and analysis, some fundamental and practical questions on glasses still remain unanswered. While most of the earlier approaches were based on (i) expert knowledge and intuition, (ii) Edisonian trial and error, or (iii) physics-driven modeling and analysis, recent studies suggest that data-driven techniques, such as artificial intelligence ({AI}) and machine learning ({ML}), can provide fresh perspectives to tackle some of these questions. In this article, we identify 21 grand challenges in glass science, the solutions of which are either enabling {AI} and {ML} or enabled by {AI} and {ML} to accelerate the field of glass science. The challenges presented here range from fundamental questions related to glass formation and composition–processing–property relationships to industrial problems such as automated flaw detection in glass manufacturing. We believe that the present article will instill enthusiasm among the readers to explore some of the grand challenges outlined here and to discover many more challenges that can advance the field of glass science, engineering, and technology.},

	abstract = {Glassy materials form the basis of many modern applications, including nuclear waste immobilization, touch-screen displays, and optical fibers, and also hold great potential for future medical and environmental applications. However, their structural complexity and large composition space make design and optimization challenging for certain applications. Of particular importance for glass processing and design is an estimate of a given composition’s glass-forming ability ({GFA}). However, there remain many open questions regarding the underlying physical mechanisms of glass formation, especially in oxide glasses. It is apparent that a proxy for {GFA} would be highly useful in glass processing and design, but identifying such a surrogate property has proven itself to be difficult. While glass stability ({GS}) parameters have historically been used as a {GFA} surrogate, recent research has demonstrated that most of these parameters are not accurate predictors of the {GFA} of oxide glasses. Here, we explore the application of an open-source pre-trained neural network model, {GlassNet}, that can predict the characteristic temperatures necessary to compute {GS} with reasonable performance and assess the feasibility of using these physics-informed machine learning ({PIML})-predicted {GS} parameters to estimate {GFA}. In doing so, we track the uncertainties at each step of the computation—from the original {ML} prediction errors to the compounding of errors during {GS} estimation, and finally to the final estimation of {GFA}. While {GlassNet} exhibits reasonable accuracy on all individual properties, we observe a large compounding of error in the combination of these individual predictions for the {PIML} prediction of {GS}, finding that random forest models offer similar accuracy to {GlassNet}. We also break down the performance of {GlassNet} on different glass families and find that the error in {GS} prediction is correlated with the error in crystallization peak temperature prediction. Lastly, we utilize this finding to assess the relationship between top-performing {GS} parameters and {GFA} for two ternary glass systems: sodium borosilicate and sodium iron phosphate glasses. We conclude that to obtain true {ML} predictive capability of {GFA}, significantly more data needs to be collected.},

	abstract = {The development of new glasses is often hampered by inefficient trial‐and‐error approaches. The traditional glass manufacturing process is not only time‐consuming, but also difficult to reproduce with inevitable variations in process parameters. These challenges are addressed by implementing an ontology‐based digital infrastructure coupled with a robotic melting system. This system facilitates high‐throughput glass synthesis and ensures the collection of consistent process data. In addition, the digital infrastructure includes machine learning models for predicting glass properties and a tool for extracting patent information. Current glass databases have significant gaps in the relationships between compositions, process parameters, and properties due to inconsistent studies and nonconforming units. In addition, process parameters are often omitted, and even original literature references provide limited information. By continuously expanding the database with consistent, high‐quality data, it is aimed to fill these gaps and accelerate the glass development process.},
